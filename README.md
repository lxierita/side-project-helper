# Side project helper

A tool that helps you getting values out of unfinished projects.

## What does it do

- it tracks the progress of your side projects and tells you about it
- it gives you a summary that reminds you what you were interested in
- it recycles untouched projects and turns them into a ~~monster~~ thing that is complete in its own right

### But why? 

I believe that the intention to start something and the initial steps taken are telling. Many things are unfinished merely because we were distracted. It is inevitable because the world just has too much stuff.
